Hello, I'm Rebeca, Data Scientist and AI Engineer with a background in Computer Engineering and a passion for solving real-world problems with data. Over the last few years, I’ve worked on projects ranging from computer vision and OCR to predictive modeling and business intelligence—always with a strong focus on creating impact. I hold a Bachelor's in Computer Engineering and I’m currently pursuing a Master’s in Data Science at the Open University of Catalonia. 

I’m especially interested in building end-to-end solutions that combine data engineering, machine learning, and intuitive visualizations. I love working with Python, SQL, PySpark and tools like Azure, Databricks, Power BI or Flask.

### 💡 What drives me

Curiosity. I enjoy taking on new challenges and learning fast. I’m not just interested in models—I care about the "why" behind the data and how to translate findings into action.

Whether I’m developing forecasting models, building dashboards for business insights, or integrating AI into real-world workflows, I focus on delivering solutions that are both technically robust and practically valuable.
